	 * Normally an array is a collection of similar type of elements
	 * Java array is an object which contain element of similar data type
	 * We can store a fixed set of elements in a Java array
	 * Size Limit issue :
	 *   We can store only the fixed size of element in array 
	 *   It doesn't grow its size in runtime
	 *   To solve this one collection framework is used in Java which grows automatically 
	 
	   - There are two types of array 
	   - Single Dimensional Array
	   -Multi Dimensional Array
